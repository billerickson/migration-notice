Lets users know this site has been migrated elsewhere.

== Description ==

Lets users know this site has been migrated elsewhere (useful so users don't keep editing content on development site).

This plugin provides you with two editors for the notice displayed on the frontend and backend. The default message is "This site has been migrated," but I like to modify it to include a link to the actual site.
